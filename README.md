        <h2 id='bc-red'> Introduction:</h2>
        <p> I am Hamza, an ordinary human with bunch of dreams but less in motivation.<br> Like an other human, i do sleep at night and dream of becoming a Pilot , Doctor, Army Officer etc like every other kid dream in childhood but only the few of them would have  acheived their goals!<br> In my Life, I loved to play cricket and want to become a cricketer and play at international platform representing my country. But like many others, by getting older day by day, i lost motivation in acheiving my goal.  </p>
        
        <h2 id='bc-red'> Failiurs of Life:</h2>
        <p> As financial problems were increasing, So i was'nt be able to give proper attention on my studies which was a great loss in my future results in <strong> I failed my Intermediate Examination with hillarious marks.</strong> </p>
        
        <h2 id='bc-red'> Catching Interest in Programming:</h2>
        <p> One of my friend was studing Computer Science in some institute. Whenever i visit her home, he tell's me about his subjects and Robotic projects which created an exellent intrest of programming in me. <br> Now, whenever i visit him, i help him in his projects which was in result of learning to program through his books.</p>
        <h2 id='bc-red'> Journey to becoming a Pro:</h2>
        <p> When i had enough intrest in programming, i just needed a right institute from where i can learn further programming at Expert level but i was'nt able to find one with affordable fees.<br> One day, i was just searching on internet about programming. I saw a video of Khan Academy and on that day, i was much impressed by their way of teaching and outstanding material on their web called <a href='https://www.khanacademy.com'> Khanacademy.com </a>. Now i'm learning through it and on One day i'll be a professional in programming Soon!</p>
